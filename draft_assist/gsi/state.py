"""Turn a raw GSI payload into draft state.

WHAT GSI ACTUALLY PROVIDES IS NOT ASSUMED HERE. Valve documents GSI thinly,
and the components a payload carries differ between playing and spectating:
a player's own feed reliably carries provider/map/player/hero/items, while
`draft` (and buildings, minimap, roshan, couriers) are understood to be
spectator/observer components. That means GSI most likely CANNOT see the
enemy team's picks in an ordinary ranked All Pick game.

So this parser extracts what is present, records what is missing, and never
invents a value. `GsiState.capabilities` reports exactly which blocks the
live game sent, `tools/probe_gsi.py` archives real payloads, and the UI
shows the verdict — the question is settled with evidence, not memory.

Hero identity is resolved through the dataset's own internal names
("npc_dota_hero_antimage"), never a hardcoded table.
