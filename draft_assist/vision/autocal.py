"""Measure where the portraits are, using heroes the game has named.

Calibrating by hand needs someone looking at the screen, and this side of
the project cannot: the crop boxes were hundreds of pixels off on an
ultrawide for days with no way to see it. But at strategy time the app
holds both halves of the answer at once — a captured frame, and the ten
heroes the minimap named in it — so the geometry can be measured instead.

Each known hero's portrait is searched for in the top strip by normalised
cross-correlation. Scale is unknown, so one hero is used to find it (over a
grid of widths and aspect ratios) and the rest are then searched at that
size. Ten rectangles give the bank starts, the pitch, the size and the top
edge directly, with no assumption about resolution or HUD scaling.

It never invents a layout: too few confident hits, or a strip that does not
fall into two banks, and it returns nothing with a reason.

# THE MIRROR IS WHAT MAKES IT TRACTABLE. Ten free rectangles is a search
# nobody can afford; two banks reflected about the HUD's centre line is
# THREE numbers — where the first portrait starts, how far apart they are,
# and how wide one is — with twenty predicted boundaries to score them on.
# Confirmed against a real 3440x1440 client: the Radiant bank ran
# 0.1137-0.4336 of the HUD box and the Dire bank 0.5664-0.8863, which is
# the same two numbers reflected to within a pixel.
#
# It also kills the false positive. Plenty of HUDs have a row of evenly
# spaced boxes in them somewhere; almost none have two runs of five that
# are each other's reflection about the centre of the screen.

    `narrowest` is the slimmest portrait allowed, as a share of its own

    pitch puts twenty boundaries on ten real edges and ten more on
    nothing, which the sum alone can still like — but it can only do that
    by claiming a portrait about half the width of its own spacing. Real
    portraits nearly touch. The live path keeps the loose 0.55 it was
    measured with, because there a drawn rectangle already pins the scale;
    a search with the start AND the scale free needs the tighter bar.

    Scored as `measure_bank` scores one bank — the sum of the boundaries

    `measure_bank` does not need because a drawn rectangle already pins the

    to be beaten on evidence: it puts twenty boundaries on ten real edges
    and leaves no gutter at all.

    `gutters` is the RAW edge profile, not the tolerant one: a gutter is
    only a tenth of a pitch wide and smearing every edge by two pixels
    either way would fill it in.

    Every candidate START is evaluated at once rather than in a Python
    loop. There are a couple of hundred of them per pitch and sixty
    pitches, and looping both took 1.4 SECONDS a frame — which matters
    even for a setup step, because the point of running it during a whole
