"""DCT perceptual hashing on numpy/cv2 — no OCR anywhere in hero
identification (see CLAUDE.md).

A portrait crop is greyscaled, resized to 4x the hash size, DCT'd, and the
top-left hash_size x hash_size block (minus the DC term) is thresholded at
its median into a bit vector. Hamming distance between bit vectors is the
match metric. hash_size is tunable (8 -> 64 bits, 16 -> 256 bits); the
proving ground picks the operating point.
