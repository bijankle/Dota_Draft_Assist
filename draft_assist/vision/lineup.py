"""Which five are yours, settled by looking at the screen.

The game feed hands over all ten heroes at strategy time but not, reliably,
whose five are whose — five recorded matches and no rule found, one of them
inverted (see CLAUDE.md). The screen has never had that ambiguity: Radiant
is always the LEFT bank of the pick bar and Dire the right, and
`player.team_name` says which of those is yours. So the split does not need
a rule at all. It needs the ten known heroes located on the bar.

That is an easier problem than recognition proper, and this module exists
because of the difference: normally the app asks "which of 126 heroes is in
this box"; here it asks "which of THESE TEN is in this box", with the
answer guaranteed to be a permutation. Ten known candidates and ten boxes
is a small assignment problem, and a wrong answer requires two heroes to
out-match each other in each other's slots rather than one hero to beat 125
rivals.

Two paths, cheap first:

* **Placed** — with calibrated crop boxes, each of the ten boxes is scored
  against each of the ten candidates and the best consistent assignment
  wins. A hundred correlations on small crops: milliseconds.
* **Searched** — no usable calibration, so every candidate is hunted across
  the top strip at an unknown scale (`autocal.locate`, which is where the
  expensive scale grid lives). Seconds, not milliseconds, so callers run it
  once per match rather than per frame.

It never guesses. Anything short of ten confident, distinct heroes falling
into two banks of five returns a reading that is `ok is False`, carrying the
reason, and the caller keeps whatever it had.
