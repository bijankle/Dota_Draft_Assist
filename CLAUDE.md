# Dota Draft Assist — domain facts and invariants

Personal-use Windows desktop app that reads the current Dota 2 draft and
shows hero/item recommendations in its own ordinary window. Single user, no
distribution, no installers.

**Draft state comes from Dota's Game State Integration (GSI) first**, with
hand-entered slots filling anything GSI does not report, and screen capture
retained only as an opt-in fallback (`--vision`). GSI is Valve's own
documented channel: a config file in the Dota install asks the game to POST
JSON to a local port, so the game volunteers its state. No pixels are
interpreted, no per-frame compute, nothing to misrecognise.

## Non-negotiable boundary

The app **never** injects code into the Dota process, hooks its rendering or
presentation chain, reads its memory, or sends synthetic input to it. It
consumes data the game itself publishes (GSI), plus — only when explicitly
enabled — pixels from a window already visible on the user's own screen. If a
feature seems to require crossing this line, stop and say so instead of
implementing it.

This rules out the Steam Game Coordinator route: libraries that log in as a
second Steam client to read live match data are unofficial, need account
credentials, and put the account at risk. Do not go there.

## Domain facts not guessable from the code

1. **Matrices hold normalised deltas, never raw win rates.** Every matchup and
   synergy figure is converted at ingestion into a delta relative to what the
   two heroes' individual baseline win rates would predict. Raw rates are
   contaminated by hero main effects; we want only the interaction term. If a
   stored matrix ever contains raw rates, every recommendation is wrong.

2. **All pick-slot coordinates are fractions of window width/height, never
   absolute pixels.** The Dota window is measured from its handle at capture
   time. Calibration nudges are stored as fractional offsets too.

3. **An unknown slot is a legitimate state, not an error.** Whether a slot is
   unresolved because GSI did not report it or because a portrait hash margin
   was too small, it is marked unknown and scoring proceeds using only the
   slots that ARE known. Silent about one slot beats wrong about one slot.
   Slots are never guessed; the user can always click one in by hand.

4. **Item rule stacking is sublinear by design.** When several enemies trigger
   the same item, severities are sorted descending and weighted 1.0 / 0.6 /
   0.4 / 0 — the item saturates because one Nullifier answers three enemies.
   A linear sum would surface the generically applicable over the specifically
   urgent. Do not "fix" this.

5. **Input automation into the game is off limits.** See the boundary above.
   The user reads recommendations and switches to Dota to click the pick
   themselves.

## Other standing decisions

- **Bracket is a user setting, not a constant.** The user plays Legend and is
  climbing to Ancient, so the DEFAULT is one bracket above — Ancient and
  Divine **combined** (summed wins / summed picks), two adjacent brackets
  aggregated deliberately for sample size. It is changed in the app (Data >
  Statistics bracket) and stored in `preferences.json`, read at call time by
  `config.target_brackets()` so the app and the pull subprocess always agree.
  Because baselines and matrices are BUILT for the chosen brackets, changing
  it invalidates the cache: the dataset records its own `target_brackets` and
  the UI banners a mismatch rather than showing one bracket's numbers under
  another's label.
- **Do not trust remembered API field names or bracket numbering** — including
  anything in this file. `tools/inspect_apis.py` dumps raw OpenDota/Stratz
  responses; parsing code validates its schema assumptions against real
  responses and fails loudly. Bracket index mappings are asserted, not assumed.
- **What GSI reports is settled by evidence, and the answer splits by
  phase.** Recordings of three real matches (~17,000 payloads, fixtures in
  `tests/fixtures/gsi/`) say:

  - The `draft` block is **`{}` in every payload ever recorded**, at every
    game state. It is not a shape the parser misreads; there is nothing in
    it. Community lore that `draft` is spectator-only is consistent with
    this. Do not write code that expects it to fill.
  - During `HERO_SELECTION` — 58 payloads in the cleanest recording — the
    feed names **no hero anywhere at all**, not even the player's own.
    Nothing can be recommended from GSI while picking; that is what the
    quick-entry bar exists for.
  - From `STRATEGY_TIME` onward the **minimap carries all ten heroes**, and
    `gsi/minimap.py` reads both line-ups out of it. Too late to choose a
    pick, in time for items and lane matchups.

  How the minimap is read, and why each guard exists — all from the recorded
  payload, none of it documented by Valve:
  - Heroes arrive as two runs of five in object order (`o0`…`o12`), the
    duplicates being the player's own hero parked at the origin.
  - **The `team` field is not usable.** Every object said `team 2` while the
    player was on Dire. Believing it puts all ten on one side.
  - Which run is yours is decided by **where your own hero is**, never by
    order. No own hero, no reading.
  - The split is verified against positions: five lane slots each hold one
    hero from each run. A single position holding two heroes from the same
    run disqualifies the reading, and fewer than three confirming positions
    rejects it. A failed check yields **nothing**, never a guess.

  `GsiState.lineup_source` says which of these produced the picks, and the
  UI shows it. `PLAYER_COMPONENTS` / `SPECTATOR_COMPONENTS` are a guide to
  what to look for, never a claim about what arrives: the same recordings
  carried `buildings`, `minimap`, `roshan`, `couriers` and `neutralitems`
  in a player's own feed, which this file had listed as spectator-only.
  `Game ▸ What did the recording contain?` re-derives all of the above from
  an archive, per phase and per match.
- **Bracket comparisons across sites are not apples to apples.** Stratz buckets
  whole matches by average rank; OpenDota counts each player at their own rank.
  That makes cross-source win rates disagree slightly even when tier labels are
  correct, so `data/verify.py` decides tier alignment on match volumes and pick
  shares, and only fails the win-rate check on an essentially-full shift.
- **The live scoring loop never makes network calls.** Data is pulled at most
  once daily and cached to disk with a timestamp.
- **Portrait matching is many-to-one**: persona/arcana portrait variants are
  separate library entries mapping to the same hero id. No OCR anywhere.
- **Ranked-role-queue role icons are ground truth** for roles, read from the
  draft screen; a manual override exists in the UI for when reading fails.
- **The item panel is measured vs. asserted**: hero scores come from data; item
  rules are hand-authored in `rules/items.yaml`. The UI labels them as such.
  Item panel shows at most 5 items above a severity floor, only after the
  user's pick is locked. Silence in many games is correct — do not tune it away.
- **The overlay sits OVER Dota, never inside it.** `ui/overlay.py` is an
  ordinary frameless always-on-top window: no DLL injection, no hooking of the
  present chain, no input sent to the game — which is what keeps it on the
  safe side of the boundary above. It needs Dota in borderless windowed mode,
  and it is deliberately interactive (not click-through) because the badge has
  to be clickable and draggable. This reverses the original spec's "no
  overlay" decision, at the user's request; the main window is unchanged.
- **GSI carries no screen geometry.** It reports game state, not pixels (the
  only coordinates in it are hero world positions). So the overlay anchors
  itself to the Dota window rectangle, which Windows supplies from the window
  handle; anything drawn against specific portraits needs coordinates from a
  saved frame, which is what the snapshot key exists for.
- **Stratz API key** lives in `.env` (`STRATZ_API_KEY=...`), gitignored since
  the first commit, read at runtime. Never hardcode, never commit.

## Development environment split

Claude Code runs on Linux and cannot run Dota, Windows Graphics Capture, or
see the screen. Only the `capture` module needs Windows + Dota, and only the
GSI listener needs a running game; everything else runs headlessly from saved
frames, cached data, archived GSI payloads, or synthetic screens. The GSI
listener itself is testable by POSTing payloads to it, which the tests do.

- `tools/probe_capture.py` — step-1 probe the user runs on Windows to confirm
  occluded-window capture works before anything is built on top of it.
- The **proving ground** (`draft_assist/proving/`) composites synthetic draft
  screens from downloaded hero portraits and runs the full vision pipeline
  against them, so recognition can be trained/tuned/regression-tested without
  the user sending screenshots.
- The **replay path** runs vision + scoring against saved frames on disk;
  awkward real cases (arcana, persona, empty slot) accumulate there as
  regression fixtures under `tests/fixtures/`.
- Windows-only deps (`windows-capture`, `pywin32`, PyQt6 runtime) are in
  `requirements-windows.txt`; the Linux dev container installs
  `requirements.txt` only.
- The app is launched by exactly one file, `Dota Draft Assist.bat`. Every
  maintenance action is a menu item running in a progress dialog; do not add
  new .bat files.

## Out of scope for the prototype

Ban-phase handling and the personal match-history review tool. Don't preclude
them architecturally; don't build them.
