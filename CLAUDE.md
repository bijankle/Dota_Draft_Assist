# Dota Draft Assist — domain facts and invariants

Personal-use Windows desktop app that reads the current Dota 2 draft and
shows hero/item recommendations in its own ordinary window. Single user, no
distribution, no installers.

**Draft state comes from GSI and the screen together, because measurement
showed neither is sufficient alone** (see the GSI evidence below). GSI —
Valve's own channel, a config file asking the game to POST JSON to a local
port — supplies the phase and your identity, which is what tells the app a
draft is happening and which bank is yours. It names no hero during hero
selection, so the picks themselves are read from the Dota window by the
vision pipeline until the minimap starts carrying them at strategy time.
Hand-entered slots fill whatever neither produced.

Precedence is strict and never blended: game-reported line-ups > screen >
hand entry > unknown. `HybridProvider` is the default. The two sources are
tick boxes in Settings (`use_gsi`, `use_vision`, both on) rather than
mutually exclusive menu commands — they answer different questions, so
turning one off is a debugging step, never a mode. `--no-vision` and
`--vision` do the same from the command line.

**Capture binds itself.** `LiveProvider` re-looks for the window titled
exactly `Dota 2` every few seconds whenever it is not bound to it, because
binding once at startup left a real session capturing a File Explorer
window called "Dota_Draft_Assist" for a whole draft. A title the user
asked for explicitly is never overridden.

## Non-negotiable boundary

The app **never** injects code into the Dota process, hooks its rendering or
presentation chain, reads its memory, or sends synthetic input to it. It
consumes data the game itself publishes (GSI), plus — only when explicitly
enabled — pixels from a window already visible on the user's own screen. If a
feature seems to require crossing this line, stop and say so instead of
implementing it.

This rules out the Steam Game Coordinator route: libraries that log in as a
second Steam client to read live match data are unofficial, need account
credentials, and put the account at risk. Do not go there.

## Domain facts not guessable from the code

1. **Matrices hold normalised deltas, never raw win rates.** Every matchup and
   synergy figure is converted at ingestion into a delta relative to what the
   two heroes' individual baseline win rates would predict. Raw rates are
   contaminated by hero main effects; we want only the interaction term. If a
   stored matrix ever contains raw rates, every recommendation is wrong.

2. **All pick-slot coordinates are fractions of Dota's 16:9 HUD box, never
   absolute pixels and never fractions of the raw window.** Dota pillarboxes
   its HUD into a centred 16:9 area, so on 3440x1440 the portraits live in
   the middle 2560 pixels; `layout.hud_box()` supplies that offset and every
   `SlotRect.to_pixels` goes through it. Treating them as fractions of the
   full width put the crop boxes 440px left of the portraits on a real
   ultrawide session. The vertical axis needs no correction — the bar hugs
   the top edge. Calibration nudges are fractional too, and are edited live
   in Debug ▸ Live with the boxes drawn on the picture.

3. **An unknown slot is a legitimate state, not an error.** Whether a slot is
   unresolved because GSI did not report it or because a portrait hash margin
   was too small, it is marked unknown and scoring proceeds using only the
   slots that ARE known. Silent about one slot beats wrong about one slot.
   Slots are never guessed; the user can always click one in by hand.

4. **Item rule stacking is sublinear by design.** When several enemies trigger
   the same item, severities are sorted descending and weighted 1.0 / 0.6 /
   0.4 / 0 — the item saturates because one Nullifier answers three enemies.
   A linear sum would surface the generically applicable over the specifically
   urgent. Do not "fix" this.

5. **Input automation into the game is off limits.** See the boundary above.
   The user reads recommendations and switches to Dota to click the pick
   themselves.

## Other standing decisions

- **Bracket is a user setting, not a constant.** The user plays Legend and is
  climbing to Ancient, so the DEFAULT is one bracket above — Ancient and
  Divine **combined** (summed wins / summed picks), two adjacent brackets
  aggregated deliberately for sample size. It is changed in the app (Data >
  Statistics bracket) and stored in `preferences.json`, read at call time by
  `config.target_brackets()` so the app and the pull subprocess always agree.
  Because baselines and matrices are BUILT for the chosen brackets, changing
  it invalidates the cache: the dataset records its own `target_brackets` and
  the UI banners a mismatch rather than showing one bracket's numbers under
  another's label.
- **Do not trust remembered API field names or bracket numbering** — including
  anything in this file. `tools/inspect_apis.py` dumps raw OpenDota/Stratz
  responses; parsing code validates its schema assumptions against real
  responses and fails loudly. Bracket index mappings are asserted, not assumed.
- **What GSI reports is settled by evidence, and the answer splits by
  phase.** Recordings of three real matches (~17,000 payloads, fixtures in
  `tests/fixtures/gsi/`) say:

  - The `draft` block is **`{}` in every payload ever recorded**, at every
    game state. It is not a shape the parser misreads; there is nothing in
    it. Community lore that `draft` is spectator-only is consistent with
    this. Do not write code that expects it to fill.
  - During `HERO_SELECTION` the feed names **no hero but your own**, and
    only once you have locked it in — as three origin duplicates that carry
    no line-up. One recording named nothing at all across 58 payloads;
    another named only the player's own hero across 156. Either way nothing
    about the other nine picks arrives while picking, which is why the
    screen is read and the quick-entry bar exists.
  - From `STRATEGY_TIME` onward the **minimap carries all ten heroes**, and
    `gsi/minimap.py` reads both line-ups out of it. Too late to choose a
    pick, in time for items and lane matchups.

  How the minimap is read, and what is still unsettled. Five recorded
  matches; none of this is documented by Valve:
  - Origin `(0,0)` entries that duplicate a hero placed elsewhere are
    dropped; an origin entry for a hero placed nowhere else is a real
    player with no lane chosen and is kept.
  - What remains is exactly ten heroes. **That part is solid.**
  - **WHICH FIVE ARE YOURS IS NOT SOLVED — but only after the draft.**
    While picking, the picks come from the SCREEN, where Radiant is always
    the left bank of the top bar and Dire the right, and `player.team_name`
    says which of those is yours: no ambiguity, and no swap is offered
    during `HERO_SELECTION`. The problem is confined to the minimap reading
    at strategy time, which is post-pick. Splitting the ten into two runs
    of five in object order and taking the run holding the player's own
    hero looked right on four recordings and came out INVERTED on a fifth,
    putting the player with four heroes from the other team. Nothing found
    so far distinguishes the sides: the `team` field is constant, the lane
    slots are placements (two team-mates share one), and object order is
    not reliably team order. So `Lineups.sides_certain` is False, the note
    says the split is a guess, and the UI carries **Swap teams**, which
    flips it for the match and resets on a new match id. Do not re-assert
    the split as fact without evidence that settles it.
  - Guards on the ten: exactly ten entries after de-duplication, ten
    distinct heroes, all resolvable, own hero among them. A failed check
    yields **nothing**, never a guess.

  **The lane slots are NOT a check.** They are where a hero was placed on
  the strategy map — yours in the lane you chose, theirs in the lane you
  predicted — and two team-mates can share a lane (pudge with axe, dragon
  knight with juggernaut in two recordings). Two attempts at using them to
  validate the split were both wrong. Do not reintroduce it.

  **Only `STRATEGY_TIME` is read**, and the first complete reading is
  latched for the match by `GsiProvider`. After strategy time the minimap
  holds real units rather than strategy-map slots and the object order
  means something else: one recorded session produced a correct split at
  16s and a scrambled one at 43s from the same match. The latch clears on
  a new `HERO_SELECTION` or a new match id.

  **The `team` field is not usable.** Every object in every recording says
  `team 2` — with the player on Dire in one and Radiant in others.
  Constant, so it distinguishes nothing.

  **Open lead:** in `PRE_GAME` the minimap carries exactly five hero
  objects (`o86`–`o90` in one recording, 163 payloads). Five, not ten, is
  what vision-limited data looks like — so those five are plausibly the
  player's own team, which would settle the split. Unverified; measure it
  before building on it.

  `GsiState.lineup_source` says which of these produced the picks, and the
  UI shows it. `PLAYER_COMPONENTS` / `SPECTATOR_COMPONENTS` are a guide to
  what to look for, never a claim about what arrives: the same recordings
  carried `buildings`, `minimap`, `roshan`, `couriers` and `neutralitems`
  in a player's own feed, which this file had listed as spectator-only.
  All of the above is re-derived from a recording, per phase and per match,
  as one section of the session report.
- **The Matrix tab is the grid a summed score hides**
  (`scoring.matchup_matrix` / `synergy_matrix`, `tables.MatrixTable`). A
  comfortable total can conceal one lane losing badly. The synergy grid
  fills only the upper triangle: synergy is symmetric, so the lower half
  would repeat it and the diagonal means nothing. "Why this score" names
  only heroes in the current game; the counters list — candidates nobody
  has picked — lives in its own panel, because mixing the two made the
  breakdown look wrong.
- **Recording needs no interaction at all** (`record.py`,
  `recordings/<timestamp>/`). With `auto_record` on (the default),
  `_consider_auto_record` starts a session the moment `game_state` reaches a
  drafting state, and `Recorder.observe()` ends it `POST_DRAFT_GRACE` after
  the game leaves one, with `MAX_SESSION` as a backstop. Frames run from the
  start of the session, not from the draft: the queue and loading screen are
  where a capture-binding fault shows up, and by hero selection it is too
  late to notice. Three cases that look like edges and are not: a blank
  `game_state` is Dota going quiet rather than the draft ending; re-entering
  a drafting state cancels the countdown; and stopping by hand mid-draft sets
  `_auto_blocked` so Auto does not immediately start another, cleared when
  the match ends. One folder per session, never pooled. Contents: payloads, draft frames, and `state.jsonl` — one
  line per tick saying what the app concluded and which source produced it.
  Sessions are never pooled; two matches in one archive made every count in
  the report meaningless. The session report grades the screen's reading
  against the minimap line-ups from the same match — the only ground truth
  available — and distinguishes a WRONG hero (advice given against a hero not
  in the game) from a MISSED one, and both from swapped sides, which is a
  mapping fault rather than a recognition one. Recorder writes are
  failure-tolerant by design: a full disk costs the recording, never the
  draft window. **The report is ONE document** — screen and game feed start
  together, so their accounts belong together: timeline, where each reading
  came from, the notes explaining every decline, the screen-vs-game score,
  then the raw payload analysis. A session of `source: none` is unreadable
  without the notes, so `snapshot_record` logs them along with whether a
  frame was captured and whether anything was recognised — capture failing
  and recognition failing are different bugs.
- **Bracket comparisons across sites are not apples to apples.** Stratz buckets
  whole matches by average rank; OpenDota counts each player at their own rank.
  That makes cross-source win rates disagree slightly even when tier labels are
  correct, so `data/verify.py` decides tier alignment on match volumes and pick
  shares, and only fails the win-rate check on an essentially-full shift.
- **The live scoring loop never makes network calls.** Data is pulled at most
  once daily and cached to disk with a timestamp.
- **Portrait matching is many-to-one**: persona/arcana portrait variants are
  separate library entries mapping to the same hero id. No OCR anywhere.
- **Ranked-role-queue role icons are ground truth** for roles, read from the
  draft screen; a manual override exists in the UI for when reading fails.
- **The item panel is measured vs. asserted**: hero scores come from data; item
  rules are hand-authored in `rules/items.yaml`. The UI labels them as such.
  Item panel shows at most 5 items above a severity floor, only after the
  user's pick is locked. Silence in many games is correct — do not tune it away.
- **The overlay sits OVER Dota, never inside it.** `ui/overlay.py` is an
  ordinary frameless always-on-top window: no DLL injection, no hooking of the
  present chain, no input sent to the game — which is what keeps it on the
  safe side of the boundary above. It needs Dota in borderless windowed mode,
  and it is deliberately interactive (not click-through) because the badge has
  to be clickable and draggable. This reverses the original spec's "no
  overlay" decision, at the user's request; the main window is unchanged.
- **GSI carries no screen geometry.** It reports game state, not pixels (the
  only coordinates in it are hero world positions). So the overlay anchors
  itself to the Dota window rectangle, which Windows supplies from the window
  handle; anything drawn against specific portraits needs coordinates from a
  saved frame, which is what the snapshot key exists for.
- **Stratz API key** lives in `.env` (`STRATZ_API_KEY=...`), gitignored since
  the first commit, read at runtime. Never hardcode, never commit.

## Development environment split

Claude Code runs on Linux and cannot run Dota, Windows Graphics Capture, or
see the screen. Only the `capture` module needs Windows + Dota, and only the
GSI listener needs a running game; everything else runs headlessly from saved
frames, cached data, archived GSI payloads, or synthetic screens. The GSI
listener itself is testable by POSTing payloads to it, which the tests do.

- `tools/probe_capture.py` — step-1 probe the user runs on Windows to confirm
  occluded-window capture works before anything is built on top of it.
- The **proving ground** (`draft_assist/proving/`) composites synthetic draft
  screens from downloaded hero portraits and runs the full vision pipeline
  against them, so recognition can be trained/tuned/regression-tested without
  the user sending screenshots.
- The **replay path** runs vision + scoring against saved frames on disk;
  awkward real cases (arcana, persona, empty slot) accumulate there as
  regression fixtures under `tests/fixtures/`.
- Windows-only deps (`windows-capture`, `pywin32`, PyQt6 runtime) are in
  `requirements-windows.txt`; the Linux dev container installs
  `requirements.txt` only.
- The app is launched by exactly one file, `Dota Draft Assist.bat`. Every
  maintenance action is a menu item running in a progress dialog; do not add
  new .bat files.

## Out of scope for the prototype

Ban-phase handling and the personal match-history review tool. Don't preclude
them architecturally; don't build them.
